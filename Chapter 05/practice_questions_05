1. What does the code for an empty dictionary look like?
empty= {}

2. What does a dictionary value with a key 'foo' and a value 42 look like?
fooValue = {'foo': 42}

3. What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?
A list is an ordered sequence of objects, whereas dictionaries are unordered sets. However, the main difference is that items in dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position. The values of a dictionary can be any type of Python data. So, dictionaries are unordered key-value-pairs.

4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?
KeyError

5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?
There is no difference. The in operator checks whether a value exists as a key in the dictionary.

6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?
'cat' in spam checks whether there is a 'cat' key in the dictionary, while 'cat' in spam.values() checks whether there is a value 'cat' for one of the keys in spam.

7. What is a shortcut for the following code?

if 'color' not in spam:
    spam['color'] = 'black'

spam.setdefault('color', 'black')

8. What module and function can be used to “pretty print” dictionary values?
pprint.pprint()
